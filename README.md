# Pig-Game
Play Pig! Pig is similar to the popular card game, Twenty-One, where the user must risk whether or not to play again. 
Will you risk it for the biscuit or play it safe? The choice is yours!

Pig was an assignment I made for my 3005 Object Oriented Programming Class. The game is similar to the game BlackJack and Twenty-One, in which one must reach a target score to win. In order to reach the target score, the user will decide whether or not to roll or hold. If the user decides to roll, the program will generate a random integer between 1 and the max number of sides on the die that the user chooses to use. For example, if the user decides to use a 15-sided die, the program will generate an integer between 1 and 15. Afterwards, that integer will be added to the user's overall score. However, if the integer "1" is generated, the user loses all points accumulated for that round. The first to reach the target score wins.
